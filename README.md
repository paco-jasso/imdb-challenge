# iMDB Challenge

Hello reader! This is a sample app to showcase my skills in a little Coding Challenge.
This App simply calls The Movie Data Base API to show on screen the most popular movies at the time. Sounds fun right?



## Project Specifications

This app was set up using Clean Architecture represented as an MVVM Pattern app.
The UI is a simple-but-effective UICollectionView briefly displaying the data from the API. When tapping an item, this opens a Details screen to show all the data from the selected movie.
This will keep a user-friendly and intuitive experience.

The app is built in Swift using Xcode as this is a challenge for an iOS Developer role.
- Xcode version    - 16.1
- Swift version    - 6.0.2 
- TMDB API version - 3.0


  
## Running the App

You can choose between the [tool install] or running directly from Xcode by cloning the project to your machine.



## Dark Mode Support

The app supports color styling based on the device settings.
NOTE: this doesn't work real-time to adapt to changes on the device settings, restart the app



## Language Support

The app supports different languages such as:
- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Italian (it)
- Japanese (ja)

The app language is based on the device settings.
NOTE: If the language is not supported, the app will show in English. Also, some translations are not on available at TMDB.
